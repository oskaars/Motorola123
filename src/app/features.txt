#1 React.js
We leverage React.js to create a dynamic and responsive user interface for our chess application. React's component-based architecture allows us to build reusable UI elements, maintain a consistent look and feel, and efficiently update the DOM when game states change. This modern JavaScript library helps us deliver a smooth and interactive chess experience.

#2 Next.js
Our application is built on Next.js, a powerful React framework that provides server-side rendering, static site generation, and client-side routing. Next.js enhances our development workflow with features like file-based routing and API routes, while optimizing performance through automatic code splitting and image optimization, resulting in faster page loads for our chess platform.

#3 TypeScript
We use TypeScript to bring strong typing to our JavaScript codebase, enhancing code quality and developer productivity. TypeScript helps us catch errors during development rather than at runtime, provides better documentation through type definitions, and makes our chess engine's complex logic more maintainable and refactorable as the project scales.

#4 Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS powers our user interface with a utility-first approach that allows rapid styling without leaving our HTML. This framework enables us to create a custom, responsive design system for our chess application while maintaining consistency across all components. Tailwind's performance optimization ensures our final CSS bundle remains lightweight.

#5 Custom Components
Our project utilizes a modular component architecture where elements like NavBar, CursorTrail, and GamePage are developed as independent, reusable units. This approach streamlines development, enhances code maintenance, and ensures a consistent user experience throughout the application. These custom components encapsulate specific functionality while maintaining a cohesive design language.

#6 Client-Side Routing
We implement seamless navigation through client-side routing, allowing users to move between different sections of our chess application without full page reloads. This technology creates a fluid, app-like experience by dynamically updating content while preserving application state. The result is faster navigation and a more engaging user journey through our chess platform.
